# Portfolio Deluxe
This is another updated version of my Web Development Portfolio. This version is only slightly different from the last one. I updated my old projects and added a new one..

## Purpose
This application is an interactive portfolio made to showcase the 
skills I have built so far in CWRU's Coding Bootcamp. It contains an about me section, a project section, a contact info section, and a resume section. It also contains links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, as well as links to my deployed applications and their repositories.
